DATA
----
A pre-release version of Urdu Propbank is being released now. Urdu Propbank contains multi-layered annotations with morphological, part-of-speech, dependency annotations, the arguments of each verb predicate (simple or complex) are marked with
their semantic roles on sentences from news domain corpus acquired from newspaper agency Siasat and other news agencies. PropBank annotation is a 2-step process. The 1st step is the creation of frame files. The next step in this process is the actual annotation of
predicate-argument structure using the created frame files. The annotations are stored in the Shakti Standard Format (See $parent_dir/docs/ssf-guide.pdf for a detailed description of the format).
